## Our Story

As international students living in the United States, we've experienced firsthand how expensive daily life can be. While living costs here might be cheaper than some of our home countries, being on our own and managing tight budgets is genuinely challenging. Every dollar counts when you're a student trying to balance academics, living expenses, and dreams of a better future.

That's why we created **MagiCart** - a smart grocery price comparison tool that helps students and budget-conscious shoppers find the cheapest prices across all major grocery stores in their area.

## Breaking the Myth

There's a common misconception that eating healthy is a luxury only the wealthy can afford. Coming from developing countries, we know this isn't true. Fresh, nutritious food should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic situation. MagiCart helps prove that you can eat well without breaking the bank - you just need to know where to shop smart.
